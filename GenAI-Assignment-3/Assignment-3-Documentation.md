# Assignment 3

Create a testing strategy for the Yahtzee scorer code that was generated and document your journey.

## Chat Conversations with ChatGPT

**User**: I've developed a Yahtzee scorer code. Now, I need to create a testing strategy to ensure its correctness and reliability. Can you guide me through creating an effective testing strategy for the Yahtzee scorer code? What types of tests should I perform?

**ChatGPT**: Certainly! Creating an effective testing strategy is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your Yahtzee scorer code. Here's a guide to help you develop a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of individual functions within your scorer code. This involves testing each scoring function separately to ensure that it calculates scores accurately for different combinations of dice rolls.

2. **Boundary Tests**: Test the scorer code with boundary cases, such as minimum and maximum possible dice rolls. For example, test with all ones (1, 1, 1, 1, 1), all sixes (6, 6, 6, 6, 6), and other extreme scenarios to ensure that the scorer handles them correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**: Identify edge cases where the behavior of the scorer may differ or where unexpected errors may occur. Test these edge cases to ensure that the scorer behaves as expected and handles edge cases gracefully.

4. **Random Tests**: Generate random sets of dice rolls and compare the scores calculated by your scorer code with the expected scores calculated manually. This helps validate the scorer's correctness across a wide range of input scenarios.

5. **Negative Tests**: Test the scorer code with invalid inputs or dice rolls that don't conform to the rules of Yahtzee. Ensure that the scorer handles such cases appropriately, such as returning a score of 0 or raising an error.

6. **Integration Tests**: Test the integration of the scorer code with other components of your Yahtzee game (if applicable). Verify that the scorer interacts correctly with the game logic and user interface, if present.

7. **Performance Tests**: If your scorer code needs to handle a large number of dice rolls or scale to multiple players, conduct performance tests to ensure that it performs efficiently and doesn't introduce significant overhead.

8. **Regression Tests**: After making changes or updates to the scorer code, rerun all the tests to ensure that existing functionality remains intact and that new changes haven't introduced any regressions.

9. **Code Coverage Analysis**: Use code coverage tools to identify areas of your scorer code that are not adequately covered by tests. Aim for high code coverage to ensure that most of your code is exercised by the tests.

By following these testing strategies, you can thoroughly validate the correctness and reliability of your Yahtzee scorer code, ensuring that it functions as expected under various scenarios and inputs.


**User**: Can you provide code for the generated tester strategies for my Yahtzee scorer code given below: 
```python
import unittest
from collections import Counter

def score(dice):
    result = {}
    counts = Counter(dice)
    
    # Ones through Sixes categories
    for i in range(1, 7):
        result[f"{i}s"] = counts[i] * i
    
    # Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, Chance categories
    result['Three of a Kind'] = sum(dice) if any(count >= 3 for count in counts.values()) else 0
    result['Four of a Kind'] = sum(dice) if any(count >= 4 for count in counts.values()) else 0
    result['Chance'] = sum(dice)
    
    # Full House
    if 2 in counts.values() and 3 in counts.values():
        result['Full House'] = 25
    else:
        result['Full House'] = 0
    
    # Small Straight
    if any(all(i in dice for i in range(start, start+4)) for start in range(1, 4)):
        result['Small Straight'] = 30
    else:
        result['Small Straight'] = 0
    
    # Large Straight
    if all(i in dice for i in range(1, 6)) or all(i in dice for i in range(2, 7)):
        result['Large Straight'] = 40
    else:
        result['Large Straight'] = 0
    
    # Yahtzee
    result['Yahtzee'] = 50 if any(count == 5 for count in counts.values()) else 0
    
    return result
```

**ChatGPT**: Certainly!
